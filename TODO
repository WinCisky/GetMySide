TO FIX:
-Instantiation of multiple mines
TO DO:
-Add mine explosion logic -> shake
-Create black holes -> shader
-Create bullet logic & instantiation -> particle system for collision, logic, movement, size, force
-Create enemy ship logic & instantiation -> camera move up/down (script)
-Hide pause button option -> settings ui: volume (music), movement speed
-Shop ui -> start stage (wrap animation), weapon, skin
-Think about a Boss
