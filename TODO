TO FIX:
-Play again logic
-Bullets behaviour on collision with other objects
-Ship tilt limit on input
TO DO:
-Add camera shake on certain events
-Create enemy ship logic & instantiation -> camera move up/down (script)
-Coordinate and make interact objects in scene
-Hide pause button option -> settings ui: volume (music), movement speed
-Shop ui -> start stage (wrap animation), weapon, skin
-Think about a Boss -> multiple traps around the scene (concentrated on the player)
(in order to pass the the player has to follow a path)
-Implement the colour system
TO TEST:
-Change input for dimension switch -> swipe right to change
-Bullet enviroment on mobile
